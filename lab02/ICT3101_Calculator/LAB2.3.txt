19.  Given the requirements above. Devise an Epic description to represent this set of requirements.
    Allow the calculations of some quality metrics in the calculator

20. Define some User Story examples for the Features.
    As an engineer 
    I want to calculate the defect density of a system in the calculator
    So that I can estimate the number of defects in the system

    As an engineer
    I want to calculate the Shipped Source Instruction (SSI) in the calculator
    So that I can estimate the number of lines of code in the system

    As an engineer
    I want to calculate the failure intensity using the MUSA Logarithmic Model in the calculator
    So that I can estimate the intensity of failures in the system

    As an engineer
    I want to calculate the number of expected failures using the MUSA Logarithmic Model in the calculator
    So that I can estimate the number of failures in the system
